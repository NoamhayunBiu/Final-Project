This repository contains all scripts used for data processing and figure generation in the final project.
The code is organized into main directories named 523847 and 769441, corresponding to the PRJNA identifiers of the experiments (PRJNA523847 – mouse in vivo data; PRJNA769441 – C2C12 in vitro EPS data).

To run a script, make sure Python is installed in your environment.
Scripts can be executed from the command line using:

./python script_name.py


(Replace script_name.py with the desired file name.)
